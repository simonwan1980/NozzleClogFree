**NozzleClogFree** is a small tool to help keep your inkjet printer in good condition by preventing nozzle clogging.

Inkjet printer heads tend to clog if the printer isn’t used for a while. Built-in cleaning functions can clear the clogs, but they waste a lot of ink. Manual cleaning is even more inconvenient and error-prone.

A simple and efficient solution is to print a small page at regular intervals — but it’s easy to forget.

**NozzleClogFree** automates this for you.

- Set your own printing schedule and page, or use the default settings.
- The app will automatically print at the scheduled time.
- It can even wake your computer from sleep to complete the printing (as long as the machine is powered on and connected to the printer).

> I built this tool after dealing with clogged nozzles one too many times. Hopefully, it can save you the same trouble.

## Features

- Customizable printing interval and page content
- Wake-from-sleep support (if system is still on and printer is connected)
- Minimal ink usage compared to built-in cleaning processes
